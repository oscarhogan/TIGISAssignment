TIGIS Python Practical Assignment
=================================

This repository includes two python files, one corresponding to each of the two tasks. 

'Tone' includes a function associated with Task 1. It reads the included 'plenty.data' file and converts them into floats. They are placed within a pair of lists with x giving all x values and y giving the set of y values corresponding with each x. The data points are then plotted using the matplotlib library


'Ttwo' includes a function associated with Task 2. It reads the 'natural_neighbourhoods' file and reproduces the data in the form of a dictionary holding the name of each neighbourhood as a key along with a list of tuples containing coordinate x,y values. The data is then plotted in the form of polygons to a map extent using matplotlib and cartopy.

Installation Instructions 
-------------------------
Download data and python files from within this repository, storing in a new folder within your working directory.

Usage 
-----
Open both python files within a code editor with python enabled, of your choice, run 'Tone' to obtain the first plotted outcome then run 'Ttwo' to receive the final map outcome.
